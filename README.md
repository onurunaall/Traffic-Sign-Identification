# Traffic-Sign-Identification

In this project, by using OpenCV and Keras, an identification algorithm has been built. With OpenCV, it is possible to preprocess the images in a way that we can use in the CNN. After preprocessing the images, by using Keras, an image generator algorithm has been coded. With that, the number of data to process increased tramendously. After that, with an basic CNN algorithm, the data set is classified.
